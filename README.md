# GLB to Colored Bricks Converter

Converts GLB 3D model files into spatially accurate colored brick structures while preserving texture colors and spatial relationships.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Convert Pepsi bottle to colored bricks with visualization
uv run python spatially_accurate_bricks.py pepsie.glb --visualize

# Convert tree to colored bricks
uv run python spatially_accurate_bricks.py tree2.glb --visualize
```

## 🎯 What This Does

- **✅ Extracts colors from GLB textures** using UV mapping
- **✅ Maps each voxel to correct spatial colors** using k-nearest neighbor interpolation  
- **✅ Handles coordinate system alignment** between voxel grid and mesh vertices
- **✅ Preserves fine color detail** (1000+ unique colors per model)
- **✅ Works with any GLB model** (trees, bottles, buildings, etc.)

## 📁 Repository Contents

- **`spatially_accurate_bricks.py`** - Main converter script
- **`pepsie.glb`** - Example Pepsi bottle model
- **`tree2.glb`** - Example tree model with brown trunk and green leaves
- **`pyproject.toml`** - Python dependencies (Open3D, trimesh, PIL, etc.)

## 🔧 Usage Options

## 📊 Results from tree.glb

Your tree.glb file was successfully converted:
- **Materials found**: 2 materials with different colors
  - `bark.001`: Brown color [37, 5, 1] → 184 bricks
  - `green.002`: Green color [0, 68, 6] → 735 bricks
- **Total bricks created**: 919 colored bricks
- **Color preservation**: ✅ Perfect - each material maintains its original color

## 🔧 Technical Approach

### How It Works
1. **Load GLB**: Uses trimesh to load GLB files with full material support
2. **Extract Colors**: Finds `baseColorFactor` from PBR materials in the GLB
3. **Process by Material**: Separates meshes by material to preserve colors
4. **Voxelize**: Converts each colored mesh to voxel grid (similar to mesh2brick)
5. **Create Bricks**: Each voxel becomes a colored cube/brick
6. **Combine**: Merges all colored bricks into single mesh

```bash
# Basic conversion
uv run python spatially_accurate_bricks.py <input.glb>

# With visualization
uv run python spatially_accurate_bricks.py <input.glb> --visualize

# Custom parameters
uv run python spatially_accurate_bricks.py <input.glb> \
  --world-size 25.0 \
  --voxel-size 0.8 \
  --k-neighbors 5 \
  --output custom_output.ply
```

## 🎨 How It Works

1. **Texture Extraction**: Samples colors from GLB texture using UV coordinates
2. **Spatial Indexing**: Builds KDTree for fast 3D spatial lookups
3. **Voxelization**: Creates voxel grid using Open3D
4. **Color Mapping**: Maps each voxel to nearest mesh vertices using k-nearest neighbor interpolation
5. **Brick Creation**: Generates individual colored cubes for each voxel

## 📈 Example Results

**Tree2.glb**: 
- 1,776 vertices → 1,493 colored bricks
- Brown trunk at bottom, green leaves at top
- 1,493 unique colors preserved

**Pepsie.glb**: 
- 5,244 vertices → 2,469 colored bricks  
- Blue bottle base, varied label colors
- 2,468 unique colors preserved

## 🔧 Technical Features

- **Coordinate Alignment**: Properly aligns voxel grid with mesh coordinates
- **Color Interpolation**: Smooth color transitions using inverse distance weighting
- **Memory Efficient**: Streams processing for large models
- **High Fidelity**: Preserves thousands of unique colors per model
